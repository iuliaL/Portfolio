				<div class="story">
					<p>The story I'll tell might be somehow unexpected to many but this 25 year old girl will tell it anyway.<br>About 7 years ago I jumped into medical school like I couldn't care less. You don't expect an 18 year old to be completely aware of her decisions. I'll use that as an excuse because I feel like I need one.<br> After proudly graduating universitary and post-universitary medical studies featuring some of the best grades and references, I began a challenging yet sometimes rewarding job as a Resident Psysician of Infectious Diseases. Months have passed and after doing a lot of thinking I decided to switch to Dermatology as this was once upon a time a choice that i would have made. Again time has passed and my expectations were still not met. Consequently, I found myself in a stage of reviewing my life. As a result, I thought that at this point and in this environment my future medical career should be at least put on hold. </p>
					<p>Then, thinking back to who you are, what you really love...<br>
					I can't say that it suddenly hit me. No. I've always loved to draw by hand, in fact this is how I spent most of my childhood. During high school I've attended architecture courses for a while and ever since I've developed a sense for space, lines and combining chromatics. I feel inspired by product and interior design and tend to spend a lot of time on keeping up with the latest trends in the industry.
